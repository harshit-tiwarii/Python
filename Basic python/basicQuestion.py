# a = b
# b = temp

# print("after swap", a)
# print("after swap", b)


# 3. Convert float value to integer

# floatValue = 23.9

# print("type of floatValue before conversion", type(floatValue))

# floatValue = int(floatValue)

# print("type of floatValue after conversion", type(floatValue))
# print(floatValue)



# 4. Write program to take details from student and print it
