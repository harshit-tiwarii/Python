"""
A set is a built-in Python data structure that represents an unordered collection of unique and immutable elements.

Definition:
- A set is defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.
- Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}` or `my_set = set([1, 2, 3])`

Features:
- Unordered: The elements have no defined order.
- Unique: Duplicate elements are automatically removed.
- Mutable: Sets can be modified after creation (elements can be added or removed).
- Elements must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples).

Example:
    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    my_set.add(5)           # Adds 5 to the set
    my_set.remove(2)        # Removes 2 from the set
    print(my_set)           # Output: {1, 3, 4, 5}
